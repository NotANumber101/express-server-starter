## Overview

This project is designed as a starting point for backend services using Express. It follows modern JavaScript best practices and includes a robust testing setup leveraging Mocha, Chai, and JSDOM for DOM-related testing needs.

## Features

- Minimal Express server setup
- Modular routing and middleware support
- Unit and integration testing with Mocha and Chai
- DOM simulation testing with JSDOM

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 18.x)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (>= 9.x) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/express-server-starter.git
cd express-server-starter
npm install
```

### Running the Server

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server will run at http://localhost:3000.
For development with live reload (requires nodemon):

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

Run the full test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

## Testing Strategy

This project uses:

- Mocha – Test runner
- Chai – BDD/TDD assertion library
- JSDOM – JavaScript implementation of the DOM for simulating browser environments

Test coverage includes:

- Unit Tests: For utilities, controllers, and small functions
- Integration Tests: For route handlers, middleware, and services
- DOM Tests: For any server-rendered HTML or frontend utility using JSDOM

You can configure pre-test hooks in test/setup.js.

## Scripts

The following NPM scripts are available:

| Command          | Description                              |
